0.1.1.1: 
    Add support for arithmoi-0.9.0.0 which had a breaking change that affected the Internals.hs file. (No change to API)

0.1.1.0:  
    Canon.hs: Substantial enhancements to support hyperexpressions as first-class numbers.  Most of the changes were to this file.
    Allow for partially factored numbers so the code will not hang endlessly on numbers with large composite factors.

0.1.0.4:
    AurifCyclo.hs: Remove fromCycloMap, cmLookup from API and remove fromCycloMap function.
                   Add exposed function getIntegerCycloMap.
                   Correct comment for crCycloInitMap                 
    Canon.hs: API change: Update set of functions exposed from AurifCyclo (in accordance with the above).

0.1.0.3:
    The Internals.hs and Additive.hs modules are no longer exposed.

    Various enhancements to documentation.

    Additions to Math.NumberTheory/Canon.hs API   ( (*) means it had previously existed in some form. )
    -------------------------------------------
        Canon(*), CanonElement, BareStatus(*), CanonValueType(*):  Types exposed to different degrees
        CycloMap, fromCycloMap, cmLookup, showCyclo, crCycloInitMap: Exposes cyclotomic map-related functionality from AurifCyclo.

        New divisor-related functions:
        cNumDivisors / cTau, cDivisors, cNthDivisor, cWhichDivisor

        New "reflection" functions:
        getBase, getExponent, getBases, getExponents, getElements
  
    Removals from Math.NumberTheory.Canon API
    -----------------------------------------
        makeC: Removed from code as well 
        (%):  Removed from code as well.  Mod operator was redundant.
        canonToGCR, cToGCR: Internal functions that should not been exposed.  canonToGCR was removed from the code itself

    Bug fix:
    --------
        cHyperOp : This did not work for the general case.  In the next larger release, this function will be enhanced
        and appropriate tests will be added.

    Bug fix for pattern PN1 in Internals.hs

0.1.0.1:
